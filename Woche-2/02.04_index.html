		<p>Here, my content will soon be shown, i just need to come up with something great to show here. Although this class is held by the <a href="https://umich.edu" target="_blank"><i>University of Michigan</i></a>, the platform i use to attend the online classes is actually not hosted by the university itself, but by an online learning institution called <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank"><i>Coursera</i>.</a></p>
		I might actually just start with a table of content, so you can easily navigate to the very important and reelvant content I am offering on this page.

		<b>Table of content</b>

			<li><a href="#Progress">Section I: GENERAL PROGRESS</a></li>

		<h4>Section I: GENERAL PROGRESS</h4>
		<p>This first section will show my progress in learning HTML. At the end of week 2 i actually learned how to create a bar that will show the progress. Sadly those bars look nice but are not very useful as long as i can't code in Java Script. It looks very professional anyway and noone needs to know that i feed in the data manually.</p><br>
		<progress value="60" max="100"></progress>
	</section>

	<section id="About_me">
		<h4>Section II: ABOUT ME</h4>
		<p>First i wanna start to introduce myself and give you a little bit of additional information about how i see myself when coding on my first website, second i will give you an insight how other people see myself and last but not least i will also get into showing you how I most likely actually do look while coding. But let's just start with one of my favourtie quotes</p> 
		<blockquote cite="Kücük-San">
		"If life gives you Corona quarantene, just learn how to code"

		<h4>Section III: ABOUT YOU</h4>
		<p>Due this this excercise i thought a lot about website content in the year 2020, about sharing meaningful texts and images and creating content that really moves people.<br> In this second section I wanna share meaningful content ideas came up with so far.</p>

		<b>1.Videos of cute kittens</b>

		<summary><h4>Section IV: ADDITIONAL CONTENT</h4></summary>
		<p>Lately a lot of my fellow www user have come up to me and asked me about yet more of my thoughtfully curated content.<br> I decided to give in and create a third, very very valuable, section of content for this page.<br> As both sections before, I'll be using this section to learn more about HTML. At the moment i am working on embedding videos and audio,<br> so am sharing this completely irrelevant video of basically nothing happening. It's really just blurry and dark and only goes on a few seconds anyway. <br> Consider yourself lucky that i didn't leave it on autoplay and loop.</p><br>

		<b>Video</b><br><br>

		<video src="Videos/Dark.MOV" style="width:30%" controls="">Dark Video with noting to see</video>

		<p>I also included some music for you. This is actually way more interesting than the video above. I hope you enjoy!</p>

		<b>Audio</b><br><br>

		<audio src="Audio/Daddy_Cool.mp3#t=00:04,00:11" controls="">Daddy Cool</audio>

		<p>The last element of this section will again be something rather boring, as Unit 2 of by class also includes coding tables. I personally don't think that i'll be using tables very often for website projects,<br> but well, you never know. To make it slightly more fun fo rme, i at least named the table after the phonetic alphabet, which i have been learning since a while</p>

		<b>Table</b><br><br>

		<table border="2">
			<tr><td colspan="4">Phonetic Alphabet</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Alpha</th><th>Bravo</th><th>Charly</th><th>Delta</th></tr>
			<tr><td>Echo</td><td>Foxtrot</td><td>Golf</td><td>Hotel</td></tr>
			<tr><td>India</td><td>Juliett</td><td>Kilo</td><td>Lima</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Mike</td><td>November</td><td>Oscar</td><td>Papa</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Quebec</td><td>Romeo</td><td>Sierra</td><td>Tango</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Uniform</td><td>Victor</td><td>Whiskey</td><td>Xray</td></tr>
			<tr><td colspan="2">Yankee</td><td colspan="2">Zulu</td></tr>
